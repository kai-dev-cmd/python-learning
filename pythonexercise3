#Exercise 3 - Cafe Menu and Total

#Step one
#Create a dictionary for menu items
menu = {
    "coffee": 5,
    "tea": 4,
    "cake": 6
}

#Step two
#Establish the total to 0 first so we can count up later
total = 0

#Step 3 (version 2)

#Ask customer
order = input("What do you want: ").lower()

#Use while so that if the answer is not "done", continue add on over and over
while order != "done":

#To check if order is available from menu and also count the total
  if order in menu:

#to grab the value of "int" (4,5,6) from the key, which is the menu item
    total += menu[order]

#Print if available and the total
    print(f"{order} is available and added to your cart. The total is RM{total}")

#Print if not available
  else:
    print("Sorry, not available")

#Ask customer again after successful, and if type "done", end the program
  order = input("Add on? (type 'done' to finish): ").lower()
print(f"Your final is RM{total}")
