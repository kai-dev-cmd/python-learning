#study places to go recommendation 
#this is just v1, but there is an idea to
#create a second dict for filters for cleaner coding

#idea
#a user ask suggestion
#for example open weekends
#program prints cafes that opens on weekends

#create dictionary
#set weekday/weekend open or not
#set price range budget to expensive
places = {
    'little dozo': {'weekday': 'open', 'weekend': 'closed', 'price': 'budget', 'cuisine': 'pastry'},
    'oct coffee house': {'weekday': 'open', 'weekend': 'open', 'price': 'mid', 'cuisine': 'coffee'},
    'biru biru': {'weekday': 'open', 'weekend': 'open', 'price': 'expensive', 'cuisine': 'bar'}
}

#show list first
print("Available cafes:")

#after 'for', you can create a new variable for the id in the nested dictionary
for cafe in places:
    print(cafe)

#then ask for input
suggest = input("What kind of cafe? / Try 'open on weekends, or budget': ")

#filter check weekend
if suggest == 'open on weekends':
    print("Cafe(s) open on weekends: ")
    #'for cafe,' now we make another var for 'places.items()'
    for cafe, info in places.items():
        #this is item you want, but it can also be info['weekday'] if thats what you look for
        if info['weekend'] == 'open':
            print(cafe)

#filter check budget
elif suggest == 'budget':
    print("Budget cafe(s): ")
    for cafe, info in places.items():
        if info['price'] == 'budget':
            print(cafe)
