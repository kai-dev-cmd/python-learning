#Mini Farm - Stock Check Exercise

#starting information - stock
#farm has 10 eggs

#tasks
#ask farmer how many eggs do you want
#if number is less than or equal to 10, print approve
#if number is more than 10, print not enough eggs

#hints
#use 'int' as input
#use 1 'if' and 1 'else'
#compare 2 numbers 

#start here
#set egg stock
eggs = 10

#'while True' is a loop

while True:
    #ask farmer
    #this input must be inside 'while True'
    #otherwise the 'else' and 'continue' won't work
    #because it doesn't know it's part of the loop to ask again
    amount = int(input("How many eggs?: "))
    
    #This is the exit loop
    if amount <= eggs:
        stock = eggs - amount
        print(f"Accepted.\nHere is {amount} eggs.\nWe now have {stock} eggs left.")
        break #and this is the function to end it
    
    else: #otherwise, this will run and return you back before the loop
        print(f"We don't have {amount}.\nWe only have {eggs} in stock.\n")
        continue #returns you to ask farmer again
